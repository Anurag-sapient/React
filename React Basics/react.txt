React- it is a javacript library becuase it has less option as compared to framework
-we can build single page application
-renders only specific part and it is fast
-arrow functions
-let x=(arg1,arg2)=>{}
-export using which can be used by other files also
-export default 
-using import we can use in file import {function/data} from './file.js'
-{data as d,function as f}->giving alias name function or data

-browser run-javascript
-computer run -nodejs

start react-
npx create-react-app app-name
npm start

jsx feature of react offering the html with javascript
important files index.js--> index.html

{variable name}=so that we could use this in react
props for accessing parents to child data transferred
-props.children get children written stuff
-props.classname get classes of children
export defualt could be used only once in one jsx/js file for particular function and could be accessed in other file by same name

For states-
use import React from 'react'
click-->onClick 
props donot changes just by assigning the value
use->prefix ones are all hooks

--helps in changing variables/props 
useState(any_variable) -->return variable,function(to change title)
let [var,func]=useState(props.title)
func('hiii')
now var=hii and can be used instead of props.title

onChange-used for reflecting the changes done to input and get it using event.target.value ->for inputs
onSubmit- for forms
event.preventdefault()-->prevents defaut behaviour and for forms prevent refreshing

two way binding-take and set data

transfer data from child to parent--->
-we can send function from parent to child using props
and give object in function so that we can get into parent that object

for making dynamic data we need backend languages dynamic saves even after refreshing
using api send data and retrieve and saves it

backend developer will give url and we can take the url and get data through api and store in object using fetch converting into json

-->useEffect(()=>{},[])->solves repeating problem
-->useEffect(function to be performed,[var(when this variable is changed)])->blank means [] only one time executed
